# Vootington

The Vootington is an open source hall-effect pcb for the V4N keyboard.

The aim of this project is to offer a functional hardware Hall-effect reference project for the community. The project is not meant to offer the full aspects of firmware. I leave that to smart people to figure out.

The keyboard takes design cues from the Wooting keyboards, [the moonpad](https://github.com/RephlexZero/MoonPad) and [the void switch keyboards](https://github.com/riskable/void_switch_65_pct) from riskable.

## Firmware

The basic firmware included in the folder is experimental and designed by KarlK90. Their work can be found here:
https://github.com/KarlK90/qmk_firmware/tree/feature/vootington/keyboards/calvin0563/vootington

Pete is currently developing more advanced HE firmware for zmk. Keep your eyes on that:
https://github.com/petejohanson/vootington-zmk-config

**beware!!!**

the hardware configuration for rgb on the vootington is currently not supported by zmk, which means no rgb with the zmk firmware.


## Todo

- [ ] create advanced firmware with full HE functionality

## Credits

big thanks to KarlK90 for making the initial firmware and for supporting the hardware design of the keyboard.

another huge thanks to pete for writing zmk firmware for this!

As always big thanks also to the many people who helped to inspire this board!
