# Vootington

The Vootington is a hall-effct minivan-style keyboard pcb. It aims to support rapid trigger and on the go adjustment of the actuation point. It requires magnetic switches such as the lekker or similar switches.

The pcb layout itself combines the [minisub](https://trashman.wiki/community/pcbs/minisub) bottom row options with the [rescuevan](https://github.com/matthewdias/rescuetruck) modifiers to allow for an ISO enter option. (Hence the shifts keys are nonstandard sized for minivans!)

Th pcb also sports the full traymount mounting point, but mileage might vary and still requires testing.

Also, it sports full per key rgb!!

The keyboard takes design cues from the Wooting keyboards, [the moonpad](https://github.com/RephlexZero/MoonPad) and [the void switch keyboards](https://github.com/riskable/void_switch_65_pct) from riskable.

## Firmware

The basic firmware is set up for vial and allows to switch rapid trigger on/off and adjustment of the actuation (!!!!) point. Make sure to assign these respective keys from the ____ tab.

## Todo

- [ ] order & test pcb
- [ ] create firmware
- [ ] test in traymount case
